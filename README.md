# MediSenseAI

Our app is designed to address the critical issues of misdiagnosis and inadequate preventative care in today's healthcare landscape. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models and advanced Machine Learning algorithms, our platform analyzes user-reported symptoms to deliver accurate, comprehensive diagnoses along with actionable steps to mitigate potential health risks. Our Machine Learning focus is on prevalent conditions such as Diabetes, Heart Attacks, and Arthritis, as these three diseases are more prevelant in our world today. 

Note: While our Machine Learning models are stored in the GitHub Repository directly, our Large Language Model is stored as a release.
